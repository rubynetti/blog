I need to test often about _title tag_ for SEO reason. The title tag is very important for Google and search motors for obvious reasons: it is the title of the page and the first thing that user see when choosing a result from the search. How to test with **minitest** inside *Rails*?

I use the meta-tag gem and sometimes I write errors often so I choose to put this part under version control for a project like significatocanzone.it where SEO is a very important topic.

Rails way is not very preoccupied with testing views issue. There are only one chapter and very small about it. But I'm lucky because the first example is exactly about my concern.
